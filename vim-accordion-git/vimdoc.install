To enforce that the current tab always shows at most 3 vsplits, run
:Accordion 3. Accordion will give you a viewport of 3 vsplits and shrink
all splits outside the viewport. As you bump against the edges of the
viewport, it will move with you. You can stop Accordion by running
:AccordionStop

While Accordion is running, use :AccordionZoomIn and AccordionZoomOut
to change the size of the viewport.

Accordion also has a special diff mode that you can start by running
:AccordionDiff. Try this when you have many versions of the same file
side-by-side in chronological order. Accordion will shrink all but two
vsplits, and visible vsplits will be diffed against each other. The
easiest way to open versions of a file is to run fugitive's :Glog
--reverse, highlight the desired changes in the quickfix list, and hit
the unstack shortcut.

For a much more detailed guide, please type :help accordion or read
